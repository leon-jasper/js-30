    // COPY the Array

    // one way

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',

      level2: {
        deep1: 1,
        deep2: 2

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    //person2.number = 1;
    //person2.age = 1;
    //console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 1 });
    console.log('person: ', person);
    console.log('person3: ', person3);
    //!!! IMPORTANT: 
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //Poor man's deep clone: 
    const person4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
